<!--
  vite by default expects an index.html file in the root of the project or a HTML file(s)
  w/ a user-defined name as defined in the vite config at the `rollupOptions.input` object
  https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#root
  https://vitejs.dev/guide/#index-html-and-project-root
  this index.html must contain a script tag with the entry point of the app
  during build, vite will copy this index.html to the dist folder
  because project is a vscode extension (and not a web app), this index.html is not actually used
  (html used instead is the one assigned to `webviewView.webview.html`)
  hence, there's a piece of code in `vite.config.webview.mts` which will automatically
  delete this index.html from the dist folder
